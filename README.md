### Project: Sales Data Analysis for Executive and Sales Departments 
In this project, I dived deep into sales data analysis for AdventureWorks. Using Tableau, BigQuery (SQL) and Google Sheet, I created a comprehensive dashboard tailored for both executive leadership and sales departments.

#### Key Insights and Strategic Solutions:

1. **Product Performance:** Identified key products driving profits and those generating losses over a period span (in fiscal year).
2. **Regional Analysis:** Highlighted regions consistently generating losses, providing a strategic focus for improvement.
3. **Sales Channels:** Analyzed the split between online and offline revenues, providing actionable insights to enhance both channels.

#### Tools & Technologies:
- **Tableau:** For interactive and insightful data visualizations.
- **BigQuery (SQL):** For robust data querying and management.
- **Google Sheet:** For basic data analytics and result extraction.


- üîç Insights for Executives: High-level strategic recommendations to enhance performance metrics and achieve organizational goals. 
- üîç Insights for Sales Department: Tactical solutions to improve team performance and collaboration across departments.

**Takeaways:**
Leveraged data to uncover actionable insights.
Demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making.
Data analytics and visualization.
